The COVID-19 pandemic began in Asia in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread widely through the continent. As of 30 April 2020,[3] at least 
one case of COVID-19 had been reported in every country in Asia except North Korea and Turkmenistan.

Excluding Russia (a transcontinental country), the Asian countries with the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases are India, Turkey, 
Iran, and Indonesia.[4] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, 
particularly Bhutan,[5] Singapore,[6] Taiwan[7] and Vietnam[8] has allowed them to fare comparatively well. China was criticised for initially 
minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.

As of May 2021, the highest numbers of deaths are recorded in India, Iran, Indonesia, and Turkey, each with more than 40,000 deaths and more than 
350,000 deaths combined. However, the death tolls in a number of countries[which?] are claimed to be significantly higher than those given in official figures.
